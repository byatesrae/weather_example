# GitHub's PAT's are currently very permissive (which is fine for local development). 
# However an alternate approach is needed for a CI pipeline. For example, one approach
# might be to use a GitHub App, installed at the org level (or per repo) with repo 
# read-only permissions. 
# Then something like https://github.com/tibdex/github-app-token can be used to 
# generate a short-lived installation token for private repo read access.
